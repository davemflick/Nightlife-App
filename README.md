#NightLife App

A freeCodeCamp fullstack project. Login to twitter, search a location for bars and mark yourself as going. See a list of everyone who is going to that particular establishment as well.
React (no redux) was used on the front-end and Node/Express/Mongodb was used on the backend.
Passport-twitter was used for login and auth.
